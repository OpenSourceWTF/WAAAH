# Ralph YOLO: Task Context & Capabilities

## Iteration 1

**Original Task:** Add the workspace context and capabilities to tasks. I also want to be able to add and remove context/capability manually in the expanded context card. I'd also like to be able to edit the prompt and status if I have to. Capabilities should be standard capabilities in a drop down when you add with a input where you can type to filter them or use to submit a custom capabilities.

**Focus this iteration:** Analyze codebase to identify required changes in backend types, DB schema, and Frontend UI.

**Previous scores:** N/A

### Decision Log
- **Why this approach?**: Need to understand the current data model and UI structure before modifying it to ensure backward compatibility and proper integration.
- **Alternates considered**: None. Analysis is required.

### Execution Log
- **Command/Action**: Reading types, DB schema, and searching for UI components.
