## Iteration 1

**Original Task:** Compare @waaah-orc-agent.md and @WORKFLOW.md and generate a gap report between the agent and the workflow.
**Focus this iteration:** Read both files, identify gaps, create detailed report
**Previous scores:** N/A (first iteration)

### Decision Log
- **Why this approach?**: Systematic comparison of each section/concept in both docs
- **Alternates considered**: Could just list differences, but criteria require detail and specificity

### Execution Log
- **Files Analyzed**:
